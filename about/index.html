        <h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>Welcome to my webpage! I am thrilled to share my passion for cybersecurity with you. With a background in Informatics Engineering and specialized studies in cybersecurity, I am dedicated to making a meaningful impact in this rapidly evolving field.</p>
<p>During my Bachelor&rsquo;s degree at the University of Firenze in Italy, I developed a strong foundation in algorithms, programming, networks, and database systems. This solid base sparked my interest in cybersecurity, driving me to pursue advanced studies and specialize in this exciting domain.</p>
<h3 id="my-education-journey">My Education Journey</h3>
<p>Motivated by my passion for cybersecurity, I embarked on an extraordinary academic journey through the EIT Digital Master School. This exceptional program provided me with a unique opportunity to pursue a Master&rsquo;s double degree in Cybersecurity, allowing me to study at two prestigious European universities: the University of Trento in Italy and the University of Twente in the Netherlands. This international exposure broadened my horizons, deepened my understanding of cybersecurity from different perspectives, and enhanced my adaptability in diverse environments.</p>
<h3 id="cybersecurity">Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>Throughout my Master&rsquo;s program, I delved into various aspects of cybersecurity, including network security, applied cryptography, multimedia data security, and security testing. These specialized courses provided me with a comprehensive understanding of key concepts and technologies in the field. With a particular interest in offensive security, I honed my skills in penetration testing and red teaming, mastering the art of identifying vulnerabilities and simulating real-world attacks. I leveraged a wide range of tools, including Burp Suite, ZAP, Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit framework, SQLmap, and Hashcat. Additionally, I acquired strong Linux administration skills, gaining proficiency in the Linux command-line interface, shell scripting, and various command-line tools.</p>
<h3 id="real-world-challenges">Real-World Challenges</h3>
<p>To further augment my expertise and practical experience, I actively engage in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges and programs. These exhilarating competitions allow me to apply my knowledge and problem-solving abilities in realistic cybersecurity scenarios. By immersing myself in these challenges, I continuously sharpen my skills in web hacking, cryptography, and system exploitation. Notably, I have participated in the prestigious CyberChallenge.IT program, which is renowned for identifying and attracting the next generation of cybersecurity professionals in Italy. This initiative has enabled me to collaborate also with the National Cyber League (U.S.), powered by Cyber Skyline, that train and test students against practical cybersecurity challenges. Through this experience, I have refined my expertise in diverse domains, including network security, web security, cryptography, software security, hardware security, access control, and OSINT.</p>
<h3 id="my-passions">My Passions</h3>
<p>Beyond my academic pursuits and CTF challenges, I have a deep passion for sports, particularly those that involve the mountains. The beauty and serenity of the mountains captivate me, and I find solace and excitement in activities such as skiing, trekking, and exploring the great outdoors. These experiences not only provide physical rejuvenation but also ignite my spirit of adventure and resilience. Additionally, my love for travel has taken me to breathtaking destinations such as islands, Norway, Finland (where I had the opportunity to complete my Erasmus program), and many others. These journeys have enriched my cultural awareness, expanded my horizons, and given me a profound appreciation for the diverse landscapes and people of the world.</p>
<h3 id="lets-connect">Let&rsquo;s Connect!</h3>
<p>In addition to my technical skills, I am proud to possess a good English language proficiency. As a certified C1 English speaker with an IELTS score of 7.5, I have honed my communication skills, enabling me to effectively convey complex ideas and collaborate with diverse teams.</p>
<p>I invite you to explore my website to discover more about my projects, write-ups, and experiences. If you wish to connect, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out.</p>
